<!-- Answer the questions -->

1. My process for this website
   First, I built up the content of the home page. After fixing the issues with the navbar and footer, I began working on other pages. Once all pages were completed, I added skip links and then added optimized photos. Finally, I added ARIA roles and schema markup. After adding all these elements, I used WAVE to check the contrast and fix any errors.

2. Challenges I faced during development and how I overcame those changes.
   As I'm not yet familiar with Bootstrap, it took me some time to adjust to this new way of thinking and I was trying to remember the usage of Bootstrap classes. Consequently, home page is the page I spent the most time on. However, after building the homepage, I found that I started to adapt and understand how to utilize Bootstrap. I especially like how Bootstrap simplifies website layout across different screen sizes, making it more convenient than using media queries alone.

Another challenge I was facing was working with CSS variables.
I understood the concept when the professor explained it in class, so I thought I already knew how to do it. However, applying it on my own is difficult. I looked back the demo for three star media again and again. I cannot say that I have already overcome this challenge, so I believe I need more practice and hands-on experience.

3. What have I learned by creating your web portfolio?
   I have been learning how to use Bootstrap, especially focusing on utilizing the col class to adjust the layout for different browser sizes.
